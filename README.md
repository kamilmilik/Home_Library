# Home_Library
* This is my projet for my studies.

* It is a very simply home library.

* It is written in node. 

* I used local mysql database. 


## Getting Started
* To run this, you must create your own database and import ````library.sql```` file into your database.
* Also in ````/routes/index.js```` change ````'MY_PASSWORD'```` to your database password.
